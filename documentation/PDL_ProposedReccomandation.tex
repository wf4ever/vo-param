\maketitle
\section*{Abstract}
This document discusses the definition of the  {\it Parameter Description Language} (PDL). In this language sentences and syntactical elements are organized into a rigorous data model. With no loss of generality, we will represent this data model using XML.\\
It intends to be a description language for self-descriptive web services exposing the semantic nature of input and output parameters, as well as all possible complex constraints. PDL is a step forward towards web services interoperability. 
\section{Status of this document}
This document has been produced by the  Grid and Web Service Working Group. It follows the previous working draft.

\section{Introduction}

In the context of the {\it International Virtual Observatory Alliance} researchers would like to
provide astronomical services to the community. \\
These services could be
\begin{itemize}
\item  an access to an existing catalogue of images and/or data,
\item an access to smaller sub-products images, spectra and/or data generated on the fly,
\item  the entry point to a database listing the results of complex  and heavy numerical simulations,
\item a computation code exposed online, etc... 
\end{itemize}
In the following we will ignore any specific feature and will use the term {\it generic service} to
refer to any kind of process that receives input parameters and produces output ones.\\

Interoperability with other services and the immediacy of use are two key points for the success of a service:
in general, a service will not be used by the community if users do not know how to call it, the inputs it needs, what it does and how. However, other issues may have influence in the user decision e.g. who has implement it, who is the service provider, does it implement a well known technique, is there a paper to support the research behind the service, can I use it as a standalone application and can it be used together with other services. 
A new service will be more useful for some users if it can be released easily as an interactive and standalone application whereas other users consider essential the interoperability with other services and applications. 
Indeed, Service description and interoperability are two key points for building efficient and useful services. 

Since PDL aim is to solve both these issues, this document is focused on these two aspects. 
With PDL service providers will be able to share with users (intended as human or as computer systems) 
the knowledge of what the service does (and how).
Moreover this new service will be immediately interactive and well integrated with other services.\\

{\bf Service description} and {\bf Interoperability} are indeed two key points for building
efficient and useful services.

\subsection{The service description: existing solutions and specific needs}
For a client starting to interact with an unknown service, its description is fundamental: in a
sense it is this description that puts the service from the {\it unknown} to the {\it known}
state.\\
Since the client could be a computer system, a generic description should be machine-readable.\\

There are several description languages.


 The most known for their high expression level and their
wide use are the \emph{W3C} \emph{WSDL} and
\textit{WADL}.\\
Since both {\it WSDL} and {\it WADL} support {\it XML-schema}, one could include in these languages complex and highly specialized 
XML objects for expressing conditions and/or restrictions. However, the process for building these ad-hoc XML types is not standard\footnote{For example, for expressing that a given parameter must be greater and smaller than arbitrary values, we could define a {\it bounded} type containing an {\it inf} field and a {\it sup} field. If another user define a similar object calling these two fields {\it inf-bound} and {\it sub-bound}, the instances of these two types could not interoperate straightforwardly. The theory of types is not sufficient to ensure the interoperability of the object defined.}: 
people providing a given service could only describe, using the native standard feature of WADL or WSDL, primitive-typed parameters. It thus serves a roughly similar purpose as a method-signature in a programming language, with no possibility for defining 
restrictions, semantics and criteria to satisfy. PDL propose a way for expressing these elements in a unified way.\\

In the case of {\it generic services} for science, description needs are very specific: since we
have to deal with complex formalisms and models, one should be able to describe for each parameter its
physical meaning, its unit and precision and the range (or set) of admissible values (according to
the model).\\ 
In many cases, especially for theoretical simulations, parameters could be linked by
complex conditions or have to satisfy, under given conditions, a set of constraints (that could
involve mathematical properties and formulas).

Two examples of this high level description we would be able to provide are the following:

\begin{equation}\label{PDLExemplum01}
\mbox{Service1 }\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\ \mbox{Input } \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 \mbox{$\vec p_1$ is a $m/s$ vector speed and $\| \vec p_1\|<c$} \\
 \mbox{ $p_2$ is time (in second) and $p_2 \geq 0$ }\\
 \mbox{$p_3$ is a $kg$ mass and $p_3 > 0$}\\
\end{array}
\right. \\
\\
\ \mbox{\hspace{1cm} Output } \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
 \mbox{ $p_4$ is a Joule Kinetic Energy and $p_4 \geq 0$} \\
 \mbox{ $p_5$ is a distance (in meter) }\\
 \end{array}
\right.\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{PDLExemplum02}
\mbox{Service2 } \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\ \mbox{Input } \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\ \mbox{ $\mathbb R \ni p_1 >0$; $p_2 \in \mathbb N$; $p_3 \in \mathbb R$} \\
\  \bullet \mbox{ if $p_1 \in ]0,\pi/2]$ then $p_2 \in \{2;4;6\}$,}\\
\ \mbox{$p_3 \in [-1,+1]$ and $\displaystyle \left( \left|  \sin(p_1)^{p_2} -p_3 \right| \right)^{1/2}<3/2$ } \\
\ \bullet \mbox{ if $p_1 \in ]\pi/2,\pi]$ then $0<p_2 < 10$,}\\
\ \mbox{$p_3>\log(p_2)$ and $(p_1 \cdot p_2)$ must belong to $\mathbb N$} \\
\end{array}
\right. \\
\\
\ \mbox{\hspace{1cm} Output } \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
 \mbox{$\vec p_4, \, \vec p_5 \in \mathbb R^3$ } \\
 \ \mbox{Always $\displaystyle \frac{\| \vec p_5\|}{\|\vec p_4 \|} \leq 0.01 $} \\
 \end{array}
\right.\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
To our knowledge, no existing description language meets these fine needs coming with scientific
services. This leads us naturally to work on a new solution and consider about developing a new
description language.\\

\noindent {\bf Remark: } The PDL descriptions for the two examples above are provided respectively in paragraph \ref{Exemplum1XML}
and \ref{Exemplum2XML}.

\subsection{Interoperability issues}\label{ParInteropIssues}
Nowadays, with the massive spread and diffusion of {\it cloud} services, interoperability has become
an important element for the success and usability of services. This remains true in the context of
astronomy.
For the astronomical community, the ability of systems to work together without restrictions (and
without further {\it ad hoc} implementations) is of high value: this is the ultimate goal
that guides the {\it IVOA}.\\

Computer scientists have developed different tools for setting up service interoperability and
orchestration. The most well known are
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it BAbel} (\href{https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/components/}{https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/components/}),
\item {\it Taverna }ÔøΩ(\href{http://www.taverna.org.uk}{http://www.taverna.org.uk}),
\item {\it OSGI} and {\it D-OSGI } (\href{http://www.osgi.org/}{http://www.osgi.org/}),
\item {\it OPalm} (\href{http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/PALM_WEB/}{http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/PALM\_WEB/}),
\item {\it GumTree} (\href{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GUMTREE/}{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GUMTREE/}).
\end{itemize}
In general, with those tools one could coordinate only the services written with given languages.
Moreover the interoperability is achieved only in a basic "computer" way: if the input of the $B$
service is a double and the output of $A$ service is a double too, thus the two services could
interact.\\

Our needs are more complex than this: let us consider a service $B'$ whose inputs are a density and
a temperature and a service $A'$ whose outputs are density and temperature too. \\
The interoperability is not so straightforward: the interaction of the two services has a sense only
if the two densities (likewise the two temperatures)
\begin{itemize}
\item have the same "computer" type (ex. double),
\item are expressed in the same system of units,
\item correspond to the same physical concepts (for example, in the service $A'$ density could be
an electronic density whereas in the service $B'$ the density could be a mass density)
\end{itemize}
But things could be more complicated, even if all the previous items are satisfied: the model behind
the service $B'$ could implement an Equation of State which is valid only if the product
(density$\times$temperature) is smaller than a given value.
Thus the interoperability with $A'$ could be achieved only if the outputs of this last satisfy the
condition on product.\\

Again, as in case of descriptions no existing solutions could meet our needs and we are oriented
towards building our own solution.\\

\noindent {\bf Remark}: We will present further considerations on the workflows aspects in paragraph \ref{PDLWF}, once we have exposed some basic concepts about PDL in the following paragraph.  

\subsection{Astronomical and Astrophysical use-cases needing PDL's fine description capabilities}
{\bf Put here the text from Franck Le Petit explaining the needs on PDR code and the text from Antoine explaining the needs for Paris-Durham code}.\\

The following sections of this document could seems complex at first reading. This is because we present all the features and the descriptive richness  of PDL. Nevertheless this not means that all the PDL descriptions are complex. They could be complex in case of services with lot of parameters linked by heavy constraints. But PDL description could be very simple in case of simple services. 
For example the PDL description associated with a common cone search service is very simple. It could be consulted at the following URL:\\
\href{
http://www.myexperiment.org/files/999/versions/4/download/AMIGA-PDL-Description.xml
}{http://www.myexperiment.org/files/999/versions/4/\\download/AMIGA-PDL-Description.xml}.

\subsection{A new Parameter Description Language: a unique solution to description and interoperability needs}
To overcome the lack of a  solution to our description and interoperability
needs, it is proposed to introduce a new language.
Our aim is to finely describe the set of parameters (inputs and outputs of a given generic services)
in a way that
\begin{itemize}
\item could be {\it interpreted} by human beings (we could say {\it understood} for the simpler description cases),
\item could be parsed and handled by a computer,
\item complex relations and constraints involving parameters could be formulated unambiguously.
Indeed we would like to express
\begin{itemize}
\item mathematical laws/formulas,
\item conditional sentences (provided they have a logical sense)
\end{itemize}
involving parameters.
\end{itemize}
The new language is based on a generic data model (DM). Each object of the DM corresponds to a
syntactic element. Sentences are made by building object-structures.
Each sentence can be interpreted by a computer by parsing the sentence-related object structure.\\

With PDL one could build mathematical expression (respectively conditional sentences) assembling the base-element described in section \ref{par02} (resp. section \ref{complexRelations}).  If a particular expression (or condition) could not be expressed using the existing features,
this modular grammar could be extended by introducing an ad hoc syntactic element into the object DM. \\

For describing the physical scientific concept or model behind a given parameter, the idea is to use
{\it SKOS} concepts
(\href{http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/}{http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/}) and, if more complexity is required by the use case, a richer ontology.\\

Since the inputs and outputs  of every service (including their constraints and complex conditions)
could be described with this fine grained granularity, interoperability becomes possible in the {\it
smart} and {\it intelligent} sense we really need: services should be able to work out if they can
sensibly use their output as input for another one, by simply looking at its description.\\

With no loss of generality and to ensure that the model could work with the largest possible number
of programming languages, we decided to fix it under the form of an XML schema (cf paragraph \ref{pdlSchema}).This choice is also
convenient because there are many libraries and tools for handling and parsing XML documents.\\

{\bf Remark:} We recall that PDL is a syntactic framework for describing parameters (with related
constraints) of generic services. Since a PDL description is rigorous and unambiguous, starting from
it, it is possible to verify if the instance of a given parameter (i.e. the value of the parameter
that a user send to the service) is consistent with the description.\\
In what follows in this document, we will often use the terms {\it evaluate} and {\it interpret}
with reference to an expression and/or conditions composed with PDL. By this we mean that one must
replace in the PDL expressions/conditions the referenced parameters  by the set of values provided to the
service by user. The replacement mechanisms will be explained in detail, case by case.

\subsubsection{PDL in the IVOA architecture}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pictures/IVOAarch.jpg} 
\caption{The IVOA Architecture, with PDL highlighted}
\label{Pic-arch}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
With the IVOA Architecture of figure \ref{Pic-arch}, PDL is a VO standard for richly describing parameters with a fine grained granularity, allowing to introduce constraints and mathematical formulae.\\
If PDL describe the nature, the hierarchy of parameters and their constraints, {\bf it  does not describe} how this parameters are transmitted to a service, nor how these parameters will be processed by the described service. For example, PDL won't tell to user if he/she has to transfer parameters through a SOAP envelope or through a REST post, nor what will be the  phases that will pass the submitted job. In the context of the IVOA, this means that the separation between PDL and UWS is clear and one can be used without the other without infringing any rules of those standards.\\
Indeed, PDL could be seen a supplementary layer, whose aim is to simplify user interaction with the VO, by explaining in a unified way the physical/computational meaning of every parameter. But, again, it is not a description of parameters values.\\
PDL could be plugged as an additional layer to every existing IVOA service and is suitable for solving issues not covered by other IVOA standards and is particularly indicated for workflows.

\subsubsection{Some consideration on PDL and Workflows}\label{PDLWF}
The orchestration of services define a Scientific Workflow, and services interoperability is key in the process of designing and building workflows. Something really important to consider in this process of orchestration is the control of parameters constraints at the moment of the workflow execution. Even if interoperability is assured at the phase of workflow design, a control at the execution phase has to be implemented by workflow engines as service clients. 
As we suggested in the remark of the previous paragraph, test for validating parameters provided to a service could be automatically generated starting from the PDL description 
%(cf for example the implementing note document REFERENCE to add after having it published on the IVOA site). 
By considering this automatization facility we suggest to perform the verification both client side and server side:
\begin{itemize}
\item verifications made client-side will avoid to send wrong set of parameters to a server, reducing the charge of the latter,
\item verifications server-side will avoid to run jobs with wrong set of parameters. Indeed a server does not know if the job is sent by a client implementing the verifications or not. Therefore it must behave as if the data had never been checked. 
\end{itemize}
Verification of non-standard errors (e.g. network issues) are out of the scope of PDL.

\section{The Service object}\label{par-service}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pictures/Service.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the Service object}
\label{Pic-Service}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The root element of the PDL description of a generic service is the object {\it Service} (see figure
\ref{Pic-Service}). This {\bf must contain}
\begin{itemize}
\item A single {\it ServiceName}. This field is a String containing the name of the service.
\item A  {\it ServiceId}. This field is a String containing the technical Id of the service.
It is introduced for a future  integration of PDL into the registries: each service in
the registry will be marked with its own unique id.
\item A  {\it Description}. This field is a String and contains a human readable description
of the service. This description is not intended to be understood/parsed by a machine.
\item A {\it Parameters} field which is a list of {\it SingleParameter} object type (cf.
paragraph \ref{par01}). This list contains the definition of all parameters (both inputs and
outputs) of the service. The two following fields specify if a given parameter is a input or an
output one.
\item An {\it Inputs} field of type {\it ParameterGroup} (cf. paragraph \ref{par-group}). This
object contains the detailed description (with constraints and conditions) of all the input
parameters.
\item An {\it Outputs} field of type {\it ParameterGroup}. This object contains the detailed
description (with constraints and conditions) of all the output parameters.
\end{itemize}


\section{The SingleParameter Object}\label{par01}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{pictures/Parameter.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the Parameter object}
\label{Pic-Parameter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it SingleParameter} object (see figure \ref{Pic-Parameter}) is the core element for describing
jobs.
Every object of this type must be characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
\item A name, which is the Id of the parameter. In a given PDL description instance, two parameters cannot 
have the same name;
\item A single parameter type, which explains the nature of the current parameter. The allowed
types are : boolean, string, rational, complex, integer, real, date;
\item A dimension. A $1$-dimension corresponds to a scalar parameter whereas a dimension
equal to N corresponds to a N-size vector. The dimension is expressed using an {\it expression} (cf.
paragraph \ref{par02}). The result of the expression that appears in this {\it
SingleParameter}-field object {\bf must be integer}.\footnote{This is obvious, since this value
corresponds to a vector size.}
\end{itemize}
The attribute {\it dependency} can take one of the two values {\bf required} or {\bf
optional}. If required the parameter {\bf must be} provided to the service. If optional, the service
could work even without the current parameter and the values will be considered for processing only
if provided.\\

Optional fields for the {\it SingleParameter} object are:
\begin{itemize}
\item a UCD : which is a text reference to an existing UCD for characterizing the parameter;
\item a Utype  : which is a reference to an existing Utype for characterizing the parameter
(\textcolor{red}{the reference is typically a text string});
\item a Skos Concept  (\textcolor{red}{the reference is typically a text string}).
\item a Unit (\textcolor{red}{which is a string reference to a valid VOUnits element}).
\item a precision. This field must be specified only for parameter types where the concept of
precision has a meaning. It has indeed no sense for integer, rational or string. It has
sense, for instance, on a real type. For understanding the meaning of this field, let the function
$f$ be a model of a given service. If $i$ denotes the input parameter, $f(i)$ denotes the output. The
precision $\delta$ is the smaller value such that $f(i+\delta) \neq f(i)$.\\ The precision is
expressed using an {\it expression} (cf. paragraph \ref{par02}). The result of the expression that
appears in this {\it precision}-field  {\bf must be} of the same type as (or could be naturally
cast to) the type appearing in the field {\it parameter type}.
%\item an optional restriction on the object which takes the form of an {\it
%AlwaysCondtionalStatement} (cf. paragraph \ref{par-AlwaysConditionalStatement}). This restriction is
%a way of placing a global restriction on a parameter that takes precedence over any constraint that
%might occur on a parameter in a {\it ParameterGroup}.
\end{itemize}

{\bf NB:} The name of every {\it SingleParameter} is unique. 

\section{The ParameterReference object}\label{par-parRef}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{pictures/ParameterRef.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the Parameter Reference object}
\label{Pic-ParameterRef}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This object, as it name suggests, is used to reference an existing parameter defined in the {\it
Service} context (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-service}). It  contains only an attribute {\it ParameterName} of type String which
must corresponds to the {\it Name} field of an existing {\it SingleParameter} (cf. paragraph \ref {par01}).

\section{The ParameterType object}\label{par-ParameterType}
This object is used to explain the type of a parameter (cf. paragraph \ref{par01}) or an expression
(cf. paragraph \ref{par02_03}). The allowed types are : boolean, string, rational, complex,
integer, real, date;

\section{The ParameterGroup object}\label{par-group}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/ParameterGroup.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the ParameterGroup object}
\label{Pic-ParameterGroup}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it ParameterGroup} object (see figure \ref{Pic-ParameterGroup}) is used for grouping
parameters according to a criterion of relevancy arbitrarily chosen by users (for instance
parameters may be grouped according to the physics : position-group, speed-group; thermodynamic-group).
However,  the ParameterGroup is not only a kind of parameter set, but also can be used for
defining complex relations and/or constraints involving the contained parameters (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-ConstraintsOnGroup}).\\
This object {\bf must contain} a single Name. This name is a String and is the identification label
of the ParameterGroup, and two groups cannot have the same Name in a given PDL description instance.\\
Optional fields are
\begin{itemize}
\item the references to the parameters (cf. paragraph \ref{par-parRef}) one want to include into the
group;
\item a  ConstraintOnGroup object {\it ConstraintOnGroup} (cf. paragraph 
\ref{par-ConstraintsOnGroup}). This object is used for expressing the complex relations and
constraints involving parameters.
\item an  {\it Active} field of type {\it WhenConditionalStatement} (cf. paragraph \ref{par-WhenConditionalStatment}). If there is no {\it Active} element the group will be considered active by default  (e.g. in case of a graphical representation it will be displayed). Otherwise, the activations depends on the result of the evaluation of the Criterion contained into the  When conditional statement (cf. paragraphs \ref{par-WhenConditionalStatment} and \ref{par-EvalCriteria}).

 
\item the objects of type {\it ParameterGroup} contained within the current root group. Indeed the
{\it ParametersGroup} is a recursive object which can contain other sub-groups.
\end{itemize}

{\bf NB:} The name of every {\it ParameterGroup} is unique.\\

%% Agree with Paul view: at the beginning I (CMZ) introduced this constraint for avoiding contradictions.
%But one could also build contradiction by putting different constraints on a given group...
%{\bf NB:} A given {\it SingleParameter} object could only belong to one {\it
%ParameterGroup}\footnote{As we will see in paragraph \ref{par-ConstraintsOnGroup}, constraints on
%parameters are defined at the level of the group. If a {\it SingleParameter} belongs only to one
%group, it will be easier to verify that there is no contradictions on conditions}.
{\bf NB:}  For any practical use, the number on the parameter referenced into a given group summed
to the number of sub-groups of the same group must be greater than one. Otherwise the group would be
a hollow shell.

\section{The Expression Objects}\label{par02}
The {\it Expression} is the most versatile component of the PDL. It occurs almost everywhere: in
defining fields for {\it SingleParameters} (cf. paragraph \ref{par01}) or in defining conditions and
criteria).\\
Expression itself is an abstract object. In this section we are going to review all the concrete
object extending and specializing expressions.\\

\noindent {\bf N.B.} In what follows, we will call a {\bf numerical expression} every {\it
expression} involving only numerical types. This means that the evaluation of such expressions
should lead to a number (or a vector number if the dimension of the expression is greater than
one).\\


\subsection{The AtomicParameter expression}\label{par02_01}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/AtomicParameter.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the AtomicParameter expression object}
\label{Pic-AtomicParameter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The {\it AtomicParameterExpression} (extending {\it Expression}, see figure
\ref{Pic-AtomicParameter}) is the simplest expression that could be built involving a defined
parameter. This object {\bf must contain} unique reference to a given parameter.\\

Optional fields, valid only for numerical types, are :
\begin{itemize}
\item A  {\bf numerical} power {\it Expression} object;
\item An  {\it Operation} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_02}).\\
\end{itemize}
Let $p$ and $exp$ be respectively the parameter and the power expression we want to encapsulate. The
composite object could be presented as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq01}
 \underbrace{  p^{exp} \underbrace{  \overbrace{\left( \begin{array}{c} + \\ - \\ \ast  \\ \cdot \\ \div   \end{array} \right) }^{\mbox{\tiny Operation type}}
 \overbrace{    \left( \mbox{AnotherExpression}\right) }^{\mbox{\tiny expression contained in operation}}   }_{\mbox{\tiny Operation object}}}_{\mbox{\tiny Atomic Parameter Expression}}
\end{equation}

To evaluate a given {\it AtomicParameterExpression}, one proceeds as follows: 
Let $d_p$, $d_{exp}$ and $d_{oo}$ be respectively the dimension of the parameter $p$ referenced, the
dimension of the power expression and the dimension of the expression contained within the operation
object.\\
The exponent part of the expression is legal if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d_p=d_{exp}$. In this case $p^{exp}$ is a $d_p$-size vector expression and $\forall$
$i=1,...,d_p$ the $i$ component of this vector is equal to ${p_i}^{exp_i}$, where $p_i$ is the value
of the $i$ component of vector parameter $p$ and $exp_i$ is the value obtained by interpreting the
$i$ component of vector expression $exp$.
\item Or $d_{exp}=1$. In this case, $\forall$ $i=1,...,d_p$ the $i$ component of the vector result
is equal to ${p_i}^{exp}$, where $p_i$ is the same as defined above.\\
\end{itemize} 

Whatever the method used, let us note $ep$ the result of this first step. We recall that the
dimension of $ep$ is always equal to $d_p$. In order to complete the evaluation of the expression,
one should proceed as shown in paragraph \ref{par02_02}, by setting there $b=ep$.

\subsection{The AtomicConstant expression}\label{par02_03}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/AtomicConstant.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of the AtomicParameter expression object}
\label{Pic-AtomicConstant}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it AtomicConstantExpression} (extending {\it Expression}, see figure \ref{Pic-AtomicConstant})
is the simplest expression that could be built involving constants. Since this object could be used
for defining a constant vector expression, it {\bf must contain}
\begin{itemize}
\item A single list of String which expresses the value of each component of the expression. Let
$d_c$ be the size of the String list. If $d_c=1$ the expression is scalar and it is a vector
expression if $d_c>1$.
\item An attribute {\it ConstantType} of type {\it ParameterType} (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-ParameterType}) which defines the nature of the constant expression. The allowed
types are the same as in the field {\it parameterType} of the object {\it SingleParameter}.
\end{itemize}
The object {\bf is legal if and only if} every element of the String list could be cast into the
type expressed by the attribute {\it constantType}.\\

Optional fields, valid only for numerical types, are : 
\begin{itemize}
\item A  {\bf numerical} power {\it Expression} object;
\item An {\it operation} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_02}).
\end{itemize}

Let $s_i$ ($i=1,...,d_c$) and $exp$ be respectively the $i$ component of the String list and the
power expression we want to encapsulate. The composite object could be presented as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \underbrace{    \overbrace{ \left( s_1  , s_2, ..., s_{d_c}\right)^{exp} }^{\mbox{\tiny List of String  to cast into the provided type}}   \underbrace{  \overbrace{\left( \begin{array}{c} + \\ - \\ \ast  \\ \cdot \\ \div   \end{array} \right) }^{\mbox{\tiny Operation type}}
 \overbrace{    \left( \mbox{AnotherExpression}\right) }^{\mbox{\tiny expression contained in operation}}   }_{\mbox{\tiny Operation object}}}_{\mbox{\tiny Atomic Constant Expression}}
\end{equation}
To evaluate a given {\it atomicConstantExpression}, one proceeds as follows: let $d_c$, $d_{exp}$
and $d_{oo}$ be respectively the dimension of the vector constant ($d_c$ is equal to one in case of scalar constant),
the dimension of the power expression and the dimension of the expression contained within the operation object.\\
The exponent part of the expression is legal if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d_c = d_{exp}$. In this case $(s_1,...,s_{d_c})^{exp}$ is a $d_c$ size vector expression and
$\forall i =1,...,d_c$ the $i$-th component of this vector is equal to $s_i^{exp_i}$, where $exp_i$
is the value obtained by interpreting the $i$ component of vector $exp$.
\item Or $d_{exp}=1$. In this case, $\forall i =1,...,d_c$ the $i$ component of the vector result is
equal to $s_i^{exp}$.\\
\end{itemize}
Whatever the method used, let us note $ep$ (whose dimension is always equal to $d_c$)  is the result
of this first step.  In order to complete the evaluation of the expression, one should proceed as
exposed in paragraph \ref{par02_02}, by substituting there $b=ep$.


\subsection{The parenthesisContent expression}\label{par02_04}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/ParenthesisContent.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of theParenthesisContent expression object}
\label{Pic-ParenthesisContent}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it parenthesisContentExpression} (extending {\it Expression}, see
\ref{Pic-ParenthesisContent}) object is used to explicitly denote precedence by grouping the
expressions that should be evaluated first. This object {\bf must contain} a unique {\bf numerical}
object $Expression$ (referred to hereafter as $exp_1$).\\
Optional fields are 
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf numerical} power {\it expression} object (referred to hereafter as $exp_2$);
\item An {\it Operation} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_02}).\\
\end{itemize}
This composite object could be presented as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \underbrace{    \underbrace{ \left( exp_1\right) }_{\mbox{\tiny Priority term}} ^{\hspace{15mm}exp_2} \underbrace{  \overbrace{\left( \begin{array}{c} + \\ - \\ \ast  \\ \cdot \\ \div   \end{array} \right) }^{\mbox{\tiny Operation type}}
 \overbrace{    \left( \mbox{AnotherExpression}\right) }^{\mbox{\tiny expression contained in operation}}   }_{\mbox{\tiny Operation object}}}_{\mbox{\tiny Parenthesis Expression}}
\end{equation}
In order to evaluate this object expression, one proceeds as follows: first one evaluates the
expression $exp_1$ that has the main priority. Then one proceeds exactly as in paragraph
\ref{par02_01} (after the equation (\ref{eq01})) by substituting $p=exp_1$ and $exp=exp_2$.

\subsection{The Operation object}\label{par02_02}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/Operation.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of Operation object}
\label{Pic-Operation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it Operation} object (see figure \ref{Pic-Operation}) is used for expressing operations
involving two {\bf numerical} expressions. This object {\bf must contain}:
\begin{itemize}
\item an {\it operationType} attribute. This attribute could take the following values: plus for the
sum, minus for the difference, multiply for the standard product, scalarProduct for the scalar
product and divide for the standard division. Hereafter these operators will be respectively denoted
$+,-,\ast,\cdot, \div$.
\item an {\it Expression} object.
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}\label{OperationEquation}
\underbrace{ \overbrace{\left( \begin{array}{c} + \\ - \\ \ast  \\ \cdot \\ \div   \end{array} \right) }^{\mbox{\tiny Operation type}}
 \overbrace{    \left( \mbox{ContaindedExpression}\right) }^{\mbox{\tiny expression contained in operation}}   }_{\mbox{\tiny Operation object}}
\end{equation}

The {\it Operation} object is always contained within a {\bf numerical} {\it Expression} (cf.
paragraph \ref{par02}) and could not exist alone.
Let $a$ be the result of the evaluation of the expression object containing the
operation\footnote{this came from the evaluation of parameterRef field in case of an {\it
AtomicParameterExpression}  (cf. paragraph \ref{par02}), from the evaluation of constant field in the
case of a {\it AtomicConstantExpression} (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_03}), from the evaluation of the Expression field in case of an  {\it parenthesisContentExpression}  (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_04}) and from the evaluation of the Function object in case of a {\it FunctionExpression} (cf. par. \ref{functionExpressionPar}) }  let $b$ the
result of the evaluation of the {\bf numerical} expression contained within the operation. As usual,
we note $d_a$ and $d_b$ the dimensions of $a$ and $b$.\\

The operation evaluation is legal if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d_a=d_b$ and operation type (i.e. the operator) $op \in \{ + , - , \ast , \div \}$. In this
case $a \, op \, b$ is a vector expression of size $d_a$ and $\forall$ $i=1,...,d_a$ the $i$
component of this vector is equal to $(a_i \, op \,b_i)$ (i.e. a term by term operation).
\item Or $d_a = d_b$ and operation type $op$ is "$\cdot$". In this case $a \cdot b$ is the result of
the scalar product $\sum_{i =1}^{d_a} a_i \ast b_i$. It is obvious that the dimension of this result
is equal to $1$.
\item Or $d_b=1$ and operation type (i.e. the operator) $op \in \{ + , - , \ast , \div \}$. In this
case $a \, op \, b$ is a vector expression of size $d_a$ and $\forall$ $i=1,...,d_a$ the $i$
component of this vector is equal to $(a_i \, op \,b)$.
\item Or $d_a=1$ and operation type (i.e. the operator) $op \in \{ + , - , \ast , \div \}$. This
case in symmetric to the previous one.
\end{itemize}

The type of the result is automatically induced by standard cast operation performed during the
evaluations (Indeed for example a double vector added to an integer vector is a double vector).

\subsection{The FunctionType object}\label{par-FunctionType}
This object is used for specifying the mathematical nature of the function contained within a {\it
Function} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_05}). The unique String field this object contains could
take one of these values:
size, abs, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, log, sum, product. In paragraph \ref{par02_05} it
is explained how these different function types are used and handled.

\subsection{The Function object}\label{par02_05}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/Function.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of Function object}
\label{Pic-Function}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The {\it function} object (extending {\it expression}, see figure \ref{Pic-Function}) is used for
expressing a mathematical function on expressions.
This object {\bf must contain} 
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\it functionName} attribute (of type {\it functionType} (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-FunctionType})) which specifies the nature of the function.
\item An {\it Expression} object (which is the function argument).\\
\end{itemize}
Let $arg$ be the result of the evaluation of the function argument expression and  $d_{arg}$ its
dimension.
The {\it function} object evaluation {\bf is legal if and only if}:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f  \in \{ \mbox{abs, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, log} \}$ and the function argument
is a {\bf numerical} expression. In this case the  result  is a $d_{arg}$-size vector and each
component  $r_i = f(arg_i$), $\forall \, i=1,...,d_{arg}$.
\item Or $f=$sum (likewise $f=$product) and the argument is a {\bf numerical} expression. In this
case the result is a scalar value equal to $\sum_{i=1}^{i=d_{arg}} arg_i$ (likewise $\prod
_{i=1}^{i=d_{arg}} arg_i$), where $arg_i$ is the value obtained
by interpreting the $i$ component of vector expression $arg$.
\item Or $f=$size. In this case the result is the scalar integer value $d_{arg}$. 
\end{itemize}
From what we saw above, the result of the interpretation of a function object { \bf is always a number}.


\subsection{The FunctionExpression object} \label{functionExpressionPar}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/FunctionExpression.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of FunctionExpression object}
\label{Pic-FunctionExpression}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The {\it FunctionExpression} object (extending {\it Expression}, see figure
\ref{Pic-FunctionExpression}) is used for building mathematical expressions involving functions.\\
This object {\bf must contains} a unique {\it Function} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_05}).\\
Optional fields, valid only for numerical types, are :
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bf numerical} power {\it Expression} object;
\item An {\it Operation} objecté (cf. paragraph \ref{par02_02}).\\
\end{itemize}

This composite object could be presented as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \underbrace{    \underbrace{ \left(\mbox{function}\right) }_{\mbox{\tiny Function object}} ^{\hspace{15mm}exp} \underbrace{  \overbrace{\left( \begin{array}{c} + \\ - \\ \ast  \\ \cdot \\ \div   \end{array} \right) }^{\mbox{\tiny Operation type}}
 \overbrace{    \left( \mbox{AnotherExpression}\right) }^{\mbox{\tiny expression contained in operation}}   }_{\mbox{\tiny Operation object}}}_{\mbox{\tiny FunctionExpression Object}}
\end{equation}
In order to evaluate this object expression, one proceed as follows: first one evaluate the funtion
expression as explained in paragraph  \ref{par02_05}. Then one proceed exactly as in paragraph
\ref{par02_01} (after the equation (\ref{eq01})) by taking $p=$function.


\section{Expressing complex relations and constraints on parameters}\label{complexRelations}
In this part of the document we will explain how PDL objects could be used for building complex
constraints and conditions involving input and/or output parameters.

\subsection{The ConstraintOnGroup Object}\label{par-ConstraintsOnGroup}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pictures/ConstraintOnGroup.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ConstraintOnGroup object}
\label{Pic-ConstraintOnGroup}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The {\it  ConstraintOnGroup} object (see figure \ref{Pic-ConstraintOnGroup}) is always contained within a {\it ParameterGroup} object and could not exist alone.
This object {\bf must contain} the {\it ConditionalStatement} objects. The latter are used, as is
shown in paragraph \ref{par-ConditionalStatement}, for expressing the complex relations and
constraints involving parameters.

\subsection{The ConditionalStatement object}\label{par-ConditionalStatement}
The {\it ConditionalStatement} object, as its name indicates, is used for defining conditional
statements. This object is abstract. In this section we are going to review the two concrete objects
extending and specializing  {\it ConditionalStatement}.

\subsubsection{The AlwaysConditionalStatement}\label{par-AlwaysConditionalStatement}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{pictures/AlwaysStatement.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of AlwaysConditionalStatement object}
\label{Pic-AlwaysConditionalStatement}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-AlwaysConditionalStatement}), as it name suggests,  is used
for expressing statement that must always be valid. It {\bf must contain} a unique {\it Always}
object (which extends {\it ConditionalClause}, cf. paragraph \ref{par-ConditionalClause}).

\subsubsection{The IfThenConditionalStatement}\label{par-IfThenConditionalStatement}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pictures/IfThenStatement.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of IfThenConditionalStatement object}
\label{Pic-IfThenConditionalStatement}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-IfThenConditionalStatement}), as it name suggests, is used for
expressing statements that are valid only if a previous condition is verified. It {\bf must
contain}:
\begin{itemize}
\item an  {\it If} object (which extends {\it ConditionalClause}, cf. paragraph
\ref{par-ConditionalClause}).
\item a {\it Then} object (which extends {\it ConditionalClause}, cf. paragraph
\ref{par-ConditionalClause}).
\end{itemize}
If the condition contained within the {\it If} object is valid, the condition contained within
the {\it Then} object {\bf must be} valid too.

\subsubsection{The WhenConditionalStatement object}\label{par-WhenConditionalStatment}
The when conditional statement is valid when the enclosed {\it When} conditional clause
evaluates to true (cf. paragraph \ref{par-EvalCriteria}). It contains a unique field of {\it When} type (cf. paragraph \ref{par-ConditionalClause}).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pictures/WhenConditionalStatement.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of a WhenConditionalStatement object}
\label{Pic-WhenConditionalStatement}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The ConditionalClause object}\label{par-ConditionalClause}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{pictures/ConditionalClause.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ConditionalClause object}
\label{Pic-ConditionalClause}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The {\it ConditionalClause} object (see figure \ref{Pic-ConditionalClause}) is abstract. It {\bf
must contain} a single {\it Criterion} object of type {\it AbstractCriterion} (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-AbstractCriterion}).\\
The four concrete objects extending the abstract {\it ConditionalClause} are (see figure
\ref{Pic-ConcreteClause}):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Always};
\item {\it If};
\item {\it Then};
\item {\it When}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/ConcreteClauses.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of Always, If and Then clauses}
\label{Pic-ConcreteClause}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The Criterion contained within a {\it Always} object must always be valid (cf paragraph
\ref{par-AlwaysConditionalStatement}).\\

The Criterion contained within a {\it When} object will be valid only when the enclosed Expression
is True (cf. paragraphs \ref{par-WhenConditionalStatment} and \ref{par-EvalCriteria} ).

The {\it If} and {\it Then} objects work as a tuple by composing the  {\it
IfThenConditionalStatement} (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-IfThenConditionalStatement}).

\subsection{The AbstractCriterion object}\label{par-AbstractCriterion}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/AbstractCriterion.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of AbstractCriterion object}
\label{Pic-AbstractCriterion}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The objects extending {\it AbstractCriterion} (see figure \ref{Pic-AbstractCriterion}) are
essentials for building {\it ConditionalStatemets} (cf. paragraph \ref{par-ConditionalStatement})
since they are contained within the {\it Always, If} and {\it Then} objects (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-ConditionalClause}).
An {\it AbstractCriterion} object {\bf must contain}:
\begin{itemize}
\item an {\it Expression} object (cf. paragraph \ref{par02});
\item a {\it ConditionType} which is an object of type {\it AbstractCondition} (cf. paragraph 
\ref{par-ConditionType}).
This object specify which condition must be satisfied by the previous {\it Expression}.
\end{itemize}
An optional field is the unique {\it LogicalConnector} object (cf. paragraph
\ref{par-LogicalConnector}) used for building logical expressions.\\
The two concrete objects extending  {\it AbstractCriterion}  are {\it Criterion} and {\it
ParenthesisCriterion}.  The difference between these two objects is in the priority they induce for
interpreting and linking the criteria (cf. paragraph \ref{par-EvalCriteria}).

\subsubsection{The Criterion object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/Criterion.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of Criterion object}
\label{Pic-Criterion}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-Criterion}) extends the  {\it AbstractCriterion} without
specializing it. It is indeed just a concrete version of the abstract type.

\subsubsection{The ParenthesisCriterion object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ParenthesisCriterion.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ParenthesisCriterion object}
\label{Pic-ParenthesisCriterion}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-ParenthesisCriterion}) extends and specialize the  {\it
AbstractCriterion}. It is used for defining arbitrary priority in interpreting boolean expression
based on criteria.
The optional field of {\it ParenthesisCriterion} is an {\it ExternalLogicalConnector} object
of type {\it LogicalConnector}. It is used for linking other criteria, out of the priority
perimeter defined by the parenthesis (cf.  paragraph \ref{par-EvalCriteria}).

\subsection{The LogicalConnector object}\label{par-LogicalConnector}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/LogicalConnector.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of LogicalConnector object}
\label{Pic-LogicalConnector}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The {\it LogicalConnector} object (see figure \ref{Pic-LogicalConnector}) is used for building
complex logical expressions. It is an abstract object and it {\bf must} contain a Criterion
of type {\it AbstractCriterion} (cf. paragraph \ref{par-AbstractCriterion}).\\
The two concrete objects extending {\it LogicalConnector} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the {\it And} object used for introducing the logical AND operator between two
criteria;\footnote{The first criterion is the one containing the {\it LogicalConnector} and the
second is the criterion contained within the connector itself.}
\item the {\it Or} object used for introducing the logical OR operator between two criteria.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The AbstractCondition object}\label{par-ConditionType}
{\it AbstractCondition} is abstract type. The objects extending it always belong to an  {\it 
AbstractCriterion} (cf. \ref{par-AbstractCriterion}). In this context, they are used combined with
an {\it Expression} object, for expressing the condition that the expression must satisfy.\\
Let us consider a given criterion object $\mathcal{CR}$ (extending{\it AbstractCriterion})  and let
us note $\mathcal E$ and $\mathcal C$ the expression and the condition contained within
$\mathcal{CR}$.
In what follows we are going to explain the different objects specializing  {\it AbstractCondition}
and their behavior.

\subsubsection{The IsNull condition}\label{par-IsNull}
This object is used for specifying that the expression $\mathcal E$ has no assigned value (this is
exactly the same concept as the NULL value in Java or the None value in Python).
Indeed, if and only if $\mathcal E$ has no assigned value, the evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal
E, \mathcal C)$ leads to a TRUE boolean value. Thus, in the case $\mathcal{CR}$ has no {\it
LogicalConnector}, the criterion is true.

\subsubsection{The "numerical-type" conditions}
These objects are used for specifying that the result of the evaluation of the expression $\mathcal
E$ is of a given numerical type. The tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ is legal if and only if
$\mathcal E$ is a {\bf numerical} expression. \\
The "numerical-type" objects extending {\it AbstractCondition}  are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it IsInteger}, in this case the evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ leads to
a TRUE boolean value if and only if the evaluation of the numerical expression $\mathcal E$ is an
integer.
\item {\it IsRational}, in this case the evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ leads
to a TRUE boolean value if and only if the evaluation of the numerical expression $\mathcal E$ is a
rational number.
\item {\it IsReal}, in this case the evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ leads to a
TRUE boolean value
if and only if the evaluation of the numerical expression $\mathcal E$ is a real number.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{The BelongToSet condition}\label{par-BelongToSet}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/BelongToSet.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of BelongToSet object}
\label{Pic-BelongToSet}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-BelongToSet}) is used for specifying that the expression $\mathcal
E$ could take only a finite set of values.
It {\bf must contain} the {\it Values} (which are objects of type {\it Expression}) defining the set
of legal values. The number of {\it Values} must be greater than one.\\
This object is legal only if all the {\it Expressions} of the set are of the same type (e.g. they
are all numerical, or all boolean or all String expressions).\\
The tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ leads to a TRUE boolean value if and only if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the expression $\mathcal E$ and the expressions composing the set are of the same type
\item and an element $\mathcal E_s$ exists in the set such that $\mathcal E_s = \mathcal E$.\\
This last equality is to be understood in the following sense: let $=_t$ be the equality operator
induced by the type (for numerical type the equality is in the real number sense, for String type
the equality is case sensitive and for boolean the equality is in the classic boolean sense).\\
Two expressions are equal if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item the expressions have the same size $d_{\mathcal E}$,
\item and $\mathcal E_s^i =_t \mathcal E^i$, $\forall i =1,...,d_{\mathcal E}$, where $\mathcal
E_s^i$ and $ \mathcal E^i$ are respectively the result of the evaluation of the
$i$ component of expressions $\mathcal E_s$ and $\mathcal E$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The ValueLargerThan object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ValueLargerThan.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ValueLargerThan object}
\label{Pic-ValueLargerThan}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-ValueLargerThan}) is used for expressing that the result of the
evaluation of the expression $\mathcal E$ must be greater than a given value.\\
It {\bf must contain}
\begin{itemize}
\item a {\bf numerical} {\it Expression} $\mathcal E_c$. 
\item a {\it Reached} attribute, which is a boolean type.
\end{itemize}
The tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ is legal only if $\mathcal E$ is a numerical expression.\\
This tuple leads to a TRUE boolean value if and only if the result of the evaluation of the
expression $\mathcal E$ is greater than the result of the evaluation
of the expression $\mathcal E_c$ and the attribute {\it Reached} is false. Otherwise if the {\it
Reached} attribute is true the expression $\mathcal E$ may be greater than or equal to the result.

\subsubsection{The ValueSmallerThan object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ValueSmallerThan.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ValueSmallerThan object}
\label{Pic-ValueSmallerThan}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-ValueSmallerThan}) is used for expressing that the result of the
evaluation of the expression $\mathcal E$ must be smaller than a given value.\\
It {\bf must contain}
\begin{itemize}
\item a  {\bf numerical} {\it Expression} $\mathcal E_c$. 
\item a  {\it Reached} attribute which is a boolean type.
\end{itemize}
The tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ is legal only if $\mathcal E$ is a numerical expression.\\
This tuple leads to a TRUE boolean value if and only if the result of the evaluation of the
expression $\mathcal E$ is smaller (otherwise smaller or equal when the  attribute {\it Reached} is
true) than the result of the evaluation of the expression $\mathcal E_c$.

\subsubsection{The ValueInRange object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ValueInRange.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ValueInRange object}
\label{Pic-ValueInRange}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-ValueInRange}) is used for expressing that the result of the
evaluation of the expression $\mathcal E$ must belong to a given interval. The definition of the
interval is made using the {\it ValueLargerThan} {\it ValueSmallerThan} objects.
Indeed, the {\it ValueInRange} object {\bf must contain}:
\begin{itemize}
\item a {\it ValueLargerThan} object,
\item a {\it ValueSmallerThan} object. 
\end{itemize}
The tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$ is legal only if $\mathcal E$ is a numerical expression.\\
This tuple leads to a TRUE boolean value if and only if the evaluation of both tuples $(\mathcal E,
\mbox{\it ValueSmallerThan})$ and $(\mathcal E, \mbox{\it ValueLargerThan})$ lead to TRUE boolean
values.

\subsubsection{The ValueDifferentFrom object}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/ValueDifferentFrom.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of ValueDifferentFrom object}
\label{Pic-ValueDifferentFrom}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-ValueDifferentFrom}) is used for specifying that the expression
$\mathcal E$ must be different from a given value.
It {\bf must contain} an {\it Expression} $\mathcal E_c$.\\
In order to be compared, the two expressions $\mathcal E$ and $\mathcal E_c$ must have the same
type.
The evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$  leads to a TRUE boolean value only if
$\mathcal E \neq \mathcal E_c$. This inequality has to be understood in the sense explained in
paragraph \ref{par-BelongToSet} (in the second point of the list).

\subsubsection{The DefaultValue object}\label{par-DefaultValue}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pictures/DefaultValue.jpg} 
\caption{Graphical representation of DefaultValue object}
\label{Pic-DefaultValue}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This object (see figure \ref{Pic-DefaultValue}) is used for specifying the default value of a
parameter.\\
It {\bf must contain} an {\it Expression} $\mathcal E_c$.\\
Since the default value of an expression involving functions, multiple parameters, etc. has no
particular sense, in the case of the present object the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$  is legal
only if
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal E$ is an {\it AtomicParameterExpression} (cf. paragraph. \ref{par02_01}) \item and
the dimension and the type of the expression $\mathcal E_c$ are equal to the dimension and type
expressed in the {\it SingleParameter} object referenced into the {\it AtomicParameterExpression}.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, for having a legal {\it DefaultValue} object, the criterion $\mathcal{CR}$ containing it must be contained within 
the {\it Always} or {\it Then}  objects (cf. paragraph \ref{par-ConditionalClause}).

\subsection{Evaluating and interpreting criteria objects}\label{par-EvalCriteria}
The evaluation of the criterion type objects (cf. paragraph \ref{par-AbstractCriterion}) always
leads to a boolean value (the only exception is what we saw in paragraph \ref{par-DefaultValue},
where the criterion contains a {\it DefaultValue} condition).\\
We use hereafter the same notation introduced in \ref{par-ConditionType}: let us consider a given
criterion (extending{\it AbstractCriterion}) $\mathcal{CR}$ and let us note $\mathcal E$ and
$\mathcal C$ the expression and the condition contained within $\mathcal{CR}$.\\
When $\mathcal{CR}$ contains no {\it LogicalConnector} objects, the evaluation of the criterion is
straightforward :
the result is equal to the boolean-evaluation of the tuple $(\mathcal E, \mathcal C)$. This tuple
is evaluated according to the concrete class involved, as explained in paragraphs \ref{par-IsNull}
to \ref{par-DefaultValue} \\
It is a bit more complex when criteria contain {\it LogicalConnectors}. Let us see how to
proceed.\\
To begin with, let us consider only {\it Criterion} concrete objects:\\
As we saw in the previous paragraphs, criteria object are (with the help of {\it
LogicalConnectors} object) recursive and hierarchical objects.\\
This hierarchical structure composing a complex criterion could be graphically represented as
follows.
\begin{equation}\label{eq-CriterionStructure01}
(\mathcal E_1, \mathcal C_1) \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_1} 
(\mathcal E_2, \mathcal C_2) \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_2}
\cdots 
(\mathcal E_i, \mathcal C_i) \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_i}
\cdots 
(\mathcal E_{N-1}, \mathcal C_{N-1}) \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_{N-1}}
(\mathcal E_N, \mathcal C_N)
\end{equation}
where the index $1$, $i$ and $N$ are respectively for the root, the $i$ and the leaf criterion
composing the structure. The term $LC_i$ denotes the {\it LogicalConnector} contained within the
criterion $\mathcal{CR}_i$.\\
As we saw in paragraphs \ref{par-IsNull} to \ref{par-DefaultValue} every tuple $(\mathcal E_i,
\mathcal C_i)$, $i=1,..,N$ could be evaluated (according to the concrete object involved) and leads
to a boolean value $\mathcal B_i$. Thus the expression (\ref{eq-CriterionStructure01}) become
\begin{equation}\label{eq-CriterionStructure02}
\mathcal B_1 \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_1} 
\mathcal B_2 \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_2}
\cdots 
\mathcal B_i \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_i}
\cdots 
\mathcal B_{N-1} \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_{N-1}}
\mathcal B_N
\end{equation}
This last is a classic sequential boolean expression. It is evaluated from left to right and the
operator AND takes precedence over the OR operator.\\

Let us now consider {\it ParenthesisCriterion}  criteria. A representation of such a criterion
$\mathcal{CR}$ could be the following:
\begin{equation}
\Big \langle  (\mathcal E , \mathcal C) \xrightarrow{LC}  \mathcal{CR}_c  \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}}  \xrightarrow{ELC}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal E$, $\mathcal C$, $LC$, $\mathcal{CR}_c$ are respectively 
the {\it Expression}, the condition, the {\it LogicalConnector} and the criterion contained within $LC$.
The term $ELC$ is the {\it ExternalLogicalConnector} of $\mathcal{CR}$.\\
The criterion structure contained within $\langle \cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}}$ has the highest
priority and has to be evaluate, before the {\it ExternalLogicalConnector} evaluation.\\

In the case where $\mathcal{CR}_c$ is composed only of {\it Criterion} objects (so with no
{\it ParenthesisCriterion}), the evaluation of the content of  $\langle \cdot
\rangle_{\mathcal{CR}}$  is performed as shown before in (\ref{eq-CriterionStructure01}) and
(\ref{eq-CriterionStructure02}).

In the case where $\mathcal{CR}_c$ contains at least one {\it ParenthesisCriterion}, one has to go
deeper in the criterion structure to find the deepest criterion $\mathcal{CR}_d$ such that $\langle
\cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_d}$ contains only criteria of type {\it Criterion}.Thus one can simply
evaluate the content of  $\langle \cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_d}$ as already shown.\\

For illustrating how to proceed, let us consider the following complex-criterion structure:
\begin{equation}\label{eq-CriterionStructure03}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle \Big \langle (\mathcal E_1, \mathcal C_1) \xrightarrow{LC_1} 
(\mathcal E_2, \mathcal C_2) \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_1 } \xrightarrow{ELC_1} 
\cdots \vspace{1mm}
\\
\hspace{1.5cm} \displaystyle \Big \langle (\mathcal E_{i-1}, \mathcal C_{i-1}) \xrightarrow{LC_{i-1}}
\Big \langle
(\mathcal E_i, \mathcal C_i) \xrightarrow{LC_i}
(\mathcal E_{i+1}, \mathcal C_{i+1}) \Big\rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_{i} }  \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_{i-1}}  \xrightarrow{ELC_{i-1}}  \vspace{1mm} \\
 \hspace{7cm} \cdots \displaystyle \Big \langle (\mathcal E_{N-1}, \mathcal C_{N-1}) \xrightarrow{LC_{N-1}}
(\mathcal E_N, \mathcal C_N) \Big\rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_{N-1} } \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

From what we saw above, the expression (\ref{eq-CriterionStructure03}) becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle \Big \langle \mathcal B_1 \xrightarrow{LC_1}  \mathcal B_2 \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_1} 
\xrightarrow{ELC_1}  \cdots \\
\displaystyle \hspace{3cm} \Big \langle \mathcal B_{i-1}  \xrightarrow{LC_{i-1}} \Big \langle \mathcal B_i 
 \xrightarrow{LC_i} \mathcal B_{i+1} \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_i} \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_{i-1}}  \xrightarrow{ELC_{i-1}}  \\
\displaystyle \hspace{7.5cm} \cdots  \Big \langle  \mathcal B_{N-1}   \xrightarrow{LC_{N-1}} \mathcal B_N  \Big \rangle_{\mathcal{CR}_{N-1}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and finally
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle \Big ( \mathcal B_1 \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_1}  \mathcal B_2 \Big ) \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{ELC_1}  \cdots \\
\displaystyle \hspace{2.5cm} \Big ( \mathcal B_{i-1} \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_{i-1}} \Big (
\mathcal B_i \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_i} \mathcal B_{i+1} \Big) \Big )  \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{ELC_{i-1}}  \\
\displaystyle  \hspace{7.5cm}  \cdots \Big (   B_{N-1}   \xrightarrow[{\mbox{\tiny AND/OR}}]{LC_{N-1}} \mathcal B_N \Big ) \,. \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
This last is a classical sequential boolean expression. It is evaluated from the left to the right.
The sub-expression between the parenthesis must be evaluated with the highest priority and the
operator AND takes precedence over the OR operator.


\section{PDL and formal logic}
We recall that PDL is a grammar and syntax framework for describing parameters and their
constraints. Since the description is rigorous and unambiguous, PDL could verify if the instance of
a given parameter is consistent with the provided description and related constraints. For example,
consider the description
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
p_1 \mbox{is a Kelvin temperature}\\
\mbox{Always }  p_1 > 0 \\
\end{array}
\right..
\end{equation}
According to the description, the PDL framework could automatically verify the validity of the
parameter provided by the user.
If he/she provides $p_1=-3$, then this value will be rejected.\\
In any case PDL is not a formal-logic calculation tool. One could build the following description
with no problem:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
p_1 \in \mathbb R\\
\displaystyle \mbox{Always } \big(  (p_1 > 0) \mbox{ AND } (p_1 < 0) \big)\\
\end{array}
\right..
\end{equation}
The PDL language grammar is not a tool with capabilities to perceive logical contradictions. 
For this reason, a validation system for PDL definitions may (or may not) implements the  detection of contradictions. This kind of considerations is out of the scope of the present document and is more axed on implementations. The current PDL developments do not implement this feature and any parameter $p_1$ provided by user will be rejected for this example.\\
In other words {\bf people providing descriptions of services must pay great attention to their contents.}\\

\section{Remarks for software components implementing PDL}
Throughout this document we have connoted PDL with the term {\it grammar}. 
If we consider it just as a grammar, then a specific description should be considered as an implementation.\\ 
We remember that, since a PDL description is detailed, it is {a priori} possible to write once for all generic software components. These components will be automatically {\it configured} by a PDL description for becoming {\it ad hoc} software for the described code. Moreover checking algorithms could also be generated automatically starting from a description instance.
In our implementations we wanted to check practically that these concepts implied in the definition of PDL really works. 
The development of operational services (as the Paris-Durham shock code) also permits to ensure the coherence of the core grammar and to verify if the PDL's capabilities could meet the description needs of state of the art simulation codes.

At the present (Fall 2013) four software elements are implemented around PDL:
\begin{itemize}
\item the standalone dynamic client. It embeds the automatic generation of the verification layer (google code repository at https://code.google.com/p/vo-param/). This development shows that a PDL description instance can be used for generating the checking algorithms and for generating a client with a dynamic-intelligent behavior helping the user in interacting with a service. This client could be used for interacting with services exposed using different job systems;
\item a server for exposing as a web services any code. It embeds the verification layer. This development was done for showing that a PDL description instance can be used for generating the {\it ad hoc} server, exposing the described service. A particular feature of this server is that it can generates grids of model starting from a single job submission, which indicates ranges for parameters (GitHub repository at https://github.com/cmzwolf);
\item the Taverna Plugin. From a point of view this plugin could be seen as an alternate client to the standalone one. From another point of view it is strongly oriented to physical and scientific interoperability (discussed in paragraph \ref{ParInteropIssues}) since it uses PDL description for validating the "chaining" of jobs composing a workflow. As the dynamic client, the Taverna plugin can be used for interacting with services exposed different job systems (GitHub repository for stable version at https://github.com/wf4ever/astrotaverna).  
\item the description editor, for editing PDL description from a Graphical User Interface. Since the key point for using PDL and take advantage of the software tools we have just described is a PDL description, we decided to provide the community with a tool for easily composing PDL description. In some sense this is the entry-point of the PDL software farmework  (google code repository at https://code.google.com/p/pdl-editor/).
\end{itemize}
All these developments validate the concepts of automatic generation of algorithms and the possibility of configuring -to a highly specialized behavior- generic software components. This is very important since it reduces drastically the development time for building services based on the PDL grammar. This is essential in a scientific context where only few scientists have access to software engineer for their IVOA developments.\\

\noindent In further developments, PDL-client implementations will include a formal-logic module. This will permit finding contradictions inside the descriptions.\\
Such a  module will also be required for implementing the automatic computation of {\it a priori interoperability graphs}. 
It will also permit checking interoperability in terms of semantic annotations: for example, let A be the concept that describes an input parameter of a service $\mathcal S$ and B the concept that describes an output parameter of a service $\mathcal S'$. If A and B are the same concept, then both services match the interoperability criterion. However, if A and B are not the same concept we need, for piping the result of  
$\mathcal S'$ to $\mathcal S$, to ask if the concept B is more specific than the concept A, in other words, if the concept B is generalized or subsumed by the concept A. If this happens then both services match again the interoperability criterion. 
Interoperability only makes sense when there is an application or infrastructure that allows communication and connection of different services. An example is the applications for orchestrating services by designing workflows (as described in section 2.2). Further developments for PDL include the implementation of interoperability mechanisms in Taverna.

The purpose of this restriction here is to allow globally true constraints to be placed on a parameter so that they do not have to be repeated in the parameter groups wherever a parameter might appear.
Although the grammar does not formally disallow it, any constraint here should not reference any other parameters as that would increase the likelyhood of contradictions.
